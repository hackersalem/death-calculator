# Death Calculator

Welcome to the Death Calculator project! This simple Python script helps users estimate their remaining life expectancy based on their current age. Whether you're curious about how much time you have left or just exploring the world of open-source projects, feel free to contribute, provide feedback, or use the calculator as a starting point for your own projects.

## Features

- **Calculate Remaining Years:** Input your age, and the calculator will determine the approximate number of years you have left to live based on a default life expectancy of 80 years.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/death-calculator.git
   cd death-calculator
Run the Script:

bash
Copy code
python death_calculator.py
Follow the Instructions:
Enter your age when prompted to get the remaining life expectancy.

Example Usage
python
Copy code
# Instantiate the DeathCalculator with a default life expectancy of 80 years
calculator = DeathCalculator()

# Get user input for age
user_age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

# Calculate remaining years
remaining_years = calculator.calculate_remaining_years(user_age)

# Display the result
print(f"Based on a life expectancy of {calculator.life_expectancy} years, "
      f"you have approximately {remaining_years} years left to live.")
